## MANUALLY FIXING INDIANA HYDROGRAPHY
Indiana NHD hydrography is too dense and drainage density is artificially bounded by the state borders. To fix this, I manually verified the general headwater drainage area for the non-Indiana portion of the drainage networks, and set stream order thresholds, usually a little below the median, to 're-extract' reasonable river networks for Indiana. Note that various network parameters than need to be adjusted: stream order, startFlag.

 StreamOrder > 2 (3+)

HUC4: 0514:
 StreamOrder > 2 (3+)

HUC4: 0512:
 StreamOrder > 2 (3+)

HUC4: 0712
 StreamOrder > 3 (4+)

HUC4: 0404:
 StreamOrder > 2 (3+)

HUC4: 0405:
 StreamOrder > 3 (4+)

HUC4: 0410:
