## One-Sentence Summary
Ephemeral streams influence downstream water quality and reveal implications of differing interpretations of the ‘Waters of the United States’

## Abstract
Ephemeral streams flow only in direct response to precipitation and are ubiquitous landscape features. However, little is known about their influence on downstream flow rates and water chemistry. Here, we model ephemeral stream water contributions to the contiguous United States network of `r formatC(nreaches, format="d", big.mark=",")` rivers, lakes, reservoirs, canals, and ditches, finding that ephemeral streams contribute, on average across basins, `r round(relativeExport[4]*100,0)`% of the discharge exported from drainage networks and comprise `r round(relativeLength[4]*100,0)`% of network extent. Our results show that the ephemeral terrestrial-aquatic connection is a substantial pathway through which water and associated pollution may enter the downstream perennial drainage network and influence water quality. The findings provide quantitative insight into the implications of the United States Supreme Court’s recent restrictive interpretation of federal regulatory jurisdiction for the United States Clean Water Act.

## Main Text
Streams transport nutrients, sediments, pollutants, and other solutes from the land surface to rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ultimately the oceans [@raymondHydrologicalBiogeochemicalControls2016; @heAssessmentGlobalNitrogen2011; @meijerMore1000Rivers2021; @liuRiversLargestSource2021; @battinRiverEcosystemMetabolism2023], influencing all downstream water quality [@alexanderFeaturedCollectionIntroduction2018; @harveyHowHydrologicConnectivity2019a]. The most upland streams (hereafter headwaters) are often 'ephemeral' streams, which flow only in direct response to precipitation and are disconnected from groundwater year-round, unlike larger downstream rivers.  Non-perennial streams (which include both ephemeral and intermittently dry rivers) account for over half of the global river network [@messagerGlobalPrevalenceNonperennial2021]. While much recent work has developed classification models to map non-perennial stream extent [@messagerGlobalPrevalenceNonperennial2021; @jaegerProbabilityStreamflowPermanence2019; @durighettoProbabilisticDescriptionStreamflow2022; @russellSpatiallyExplicitModel2015; @fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021; @cavalloExploitingSentinel2Dataset2022], nearly no work focuses specifically on ephemeral streams [@fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021; @bensteadExpandedRoleRiver2012a; @stanleyEcosystemExpansionContraction1997] and all work stops short of assessing the hydrological contributions of non-perennial streams to the overall drainage network at broad spatial scales. It is regionally established that headwater streams contribute meaningfully to downstream water quantity and quality [@alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007; @fritzPhysicalChemicalConnectivity2018], but we presently have no explicit assessment of ephemeral contributions to global hydrology, nor their potential influence on downstream water quality.

In this context, we use a simple geomorphic model to identify ephemeral stream contributions to drainage networks. First, we compare modeled long-term monthly water table depths [@fanGlobalPatternsGroundwater2013; @fanHydrologicRegulationPlant2017] with streamline presence in `r formatC(nreaches, format="d", big.mark=",")` discrete streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, canals, and ditches across the contiguous United States (CONUS) [@u.s.geologicalsurveyNationalHydrographyDataset2022]. Using this analysis and a published river-lake-reservoir routing framework [@brinkerhoffLakeMorphometryRiver2021], we identify ephemeral streams as those with no groundwater connection across all twelve months (see Supplementary Materials). Then, in conjunction with a published mean annual flow model [@u.s.geologicalsurveyNationalHydrographyDataset2022], we quantify the fraction of every river's discharge that was contributed by upstream CONUS ephemeral streams. Finally, we use 27 years of daily interpolated precipitation data [@xieGaugeBasedAnalysisDaily2007], as well as runoff and in situ sensor data (Tables S`r table_nums("data_summary", display="n")`-S`r table_nums("Nflw_data", display="n")`), to quantify how frequently ephemeral streams flow in each basin (see Supplementary Materials). We define and discuss the metrics that make up our assessment (Supplementary Materials, Equations S1-S3, Table S`r table_nums("classVal", display="n")`), validate individual model components at up to `r formatC(nMapValidation, format="d", big.mark=",")` in situ sites across CONUS (Supplementary Materials S1, Figs. S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`-S`r fig_nums_supp("walnutGulch", display="n")`, Table S`r table_nums("Nflw_data", display="n")`, Table S`r table_nums("field_data", display="n")`), and explore parameter settings and sensitivity (Figs. S`r fig_nums_supp("classificationSens", display="n")`-S`r fig_nums_supp("runoffCalib", display="n")`). By leveraging a parsimonious modeling approach and validating our analysis at thousands of in situ sites, our goal is not simply to show that ephemeral streams occur, but to elucidate how their prevalence shapes downstream hydrology. 

We conclude by relating our scientific findings to ongoing debate surrounding the jurisdictional scope of the United States Clean Water Act (CWA) and whether it applies to ephemeral streams. The CWA grants federal agencies the authority to regulate the 'Waters of the United States' (WOTUS) in order “to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters” [@CleanWaterAct1985]. While there is general agreement that WOTUS includes large interstate waterways characterized as 'navigable waters', differing and conflicting interpretations apply to wetlands and smaller/tributary interconnected waterways, especially those that are ephemeral [@walshOverviewEvolvingJurisdictional2022; @keiserConsequencesCleanWater2019]. For many years, no majority United States Supreme Court opinion controlled the scope of WOTUS, leaving regulators to navigate among competing definitions such as waters that are 'inseparably bound up' with navigable waters [@UnitedStatesRiverside1985], waters that hold a 'significant nexus' with navigable waters [@RapanosUS2006], and- most narrowly- waters that are 'relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water' [@RapanosUS2006]. In the past decade alone, federal agencies under three administrations all promulgated rules with differing definitions of the CWA's jurisdictional scope, including one that explicitly excluded ephemeral streams from federal coverage [@u.s.armycorpsofengineersdepartmentofthearmydepartmentofdefenseCleanWaterRule2015; @u.s.armycorpsofengineersdepartmentofthearmydepartmentofdefenseNavigableWatersProtection2020; @u.s.armycorpsofengineersdepartmentofthearmydepartmentofdefenseRevisedDefinitionWaters2023]. The issue was addressed once again by the United States Supreme Court in the 2023 case of Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where a majority of the Court narrowly defined WOTUS as encompassing “only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographical features that are described in ordinary parlance as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes” [@SackettEnvironmentalProtection2022]. Our assessment provides a comprehensive appraisal of ephemeral streams across CONUS and may help in establishing the importance of ephemeral streams to water quality regulation, notwithstanding their exclusion from the new WOTUS definition

### The ephemeral pulse of drainage networks
On average across CONUS basins, we predict `r round(relativeExport[4]*100,0)`% of annual drainage network discharge by water volume is sourced from upstream ephemeral streams (Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`a). This varies significantly across basins (from `r round(relativeExport[1]*100,0)`% to `r round(relativeExport[6]*100,0)`%), with generally greater ephemeral influence in basins west of the Mississippi River. Hereafter, we refer to this region as 'West', with basins east of the Mississippi River referred to as 'East'. Regional hotspots occur where ephemeral streams most dominate the landscape, namely the desert and endorheic basins of the southwest and Great Basin (Figs. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`, S`r fig_nums_supp("hydrographies1", display="n")`-S`r fig_nums_supp("hydrographies13", display="n")`). However, ephemeral contributions to discharge are consistently high across CONUS: `r round((overFifty/nrow(combined_results))*100,0)`% of networks export water that is at least 50% ephemeral and the largest rivers in the United States export large volumes of ephemeral water: the Mississippi River export is `r round(mississippi$percQEph_export*100,0)`% originating from ephemeral reaches and the Columbia river export is `r round(columbia$percQEph_export*100,0)`% ephemeral. We also express the ephemeral contribution to discharge as a function of drainage area (Supplementary Materials, Equation S2), where on average across basins `r round(relativeExport_da[4]*100,0)`% of a basin's upstream drainage area is ephemeral and there is a clear east/west divide in land surface contributions to drainage networks (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("drainageAreaMap", display="n")`). Given that water generally accumulates in drainage networks that follow predictable scaling patterns [@tarbotonFractalNatureRiver1988; @zanardoAreAmericanRivers2013; @doddsScalingUniversalityGeomorphology2000; @tokunagaConsiderationsCompositionDrainage1978; @alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007], our results (Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`a) are theoretically anticipated by the average upstream ephemeral network extent (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`c, Supplementary Materials S1). Our results also agree with previous modeling in northeastern CONUS, where 70% of exported discharge is sourced from headwater streams, regardless of their ephemerality [@alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007].

Ephemeral stream hydrography (Figs. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`b-e and S`r fig_nums_supp("hydrographies1", display="n")`-S`r fig_nums_supp("hydrographies13", display="n")`) is largely governed by lateral groundwater fluxes and watershed geomorphology and is a result of both topography and climate [@gleesonClassifyingWaterTable2011; @condonEvaluatingRelationshipTopography2015]. In the East, ephemeral streams are most numerous in upland settings, where they sit upslope of the groundwater point of emergence (e.g. Figs. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`d-e). In much of the West, where the water table is kilometers below the surface, ephemeral streams can dominate the landscape (Figs. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`b-c). The Great Lakes/Upper Midwest region and Florida have the smallest ephemeral influence due to low-order networks with persistently shallow water tables [@fanHydrologicRegulationPlant2017]. The Midwest region is also strongly influenced by artificial irrigation ditches, which are not natural ephemeral streams but contribute significantly to discharge. Their contributions dilute the ephemeral influence on discharge exported from the drainage networks.

Internal to drainage networks, we predict stream size exerts a fundamental control on the ephemeral contribution to downstream hydrology (Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ_SO", display="n")`). Median first-order discharge is, on average across basins, `r round(relativeExport_order1[4]*100,0)`% ephemerally sourced (Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ_SO", display="n")`a points and lines). This result varies predictably for basins east and west of the Mississippi River (`r round(relativeExportEast_order1[4]*100,0)`% versus `r round(relativeExportWest_order1[4]*100,0)`%, respectively). Given the first-order control of topography on eastern ephemeral stream presence (Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`), the eastern ephemeral contribution decreases rapidly to approximately 50% in large rivers, while in western basins it decreases more slowly with stream size (Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ_SO", display="n")`a). The ephemeral drainage area percent decreases similarly with stream size (Fig `r fig_nums("figQ_SO", display="n")`b). Overall, these results are driven by the sheer extent of ephemeral streams in orders 1-3 in the East and 1-5 in the West (Fig `r fig_nums("figQ_SO", display="n")`c). Our results and river network scaling theory imply that non-perennial rivers, which make up over half of the global river network [@messagerGlobalPrevalenceNonperennial2021], are likely predominately ephemeral streams rather than intermittently dry rivers.

We limit our ephemeral stream analysis to CONUS ephemeral streams because Mexican/Canadian rivers (as well as any canals, ditches, and ponds) fall under different water quality regulation rules. We also do not account for human groundwater pumping (see Supplementary Materials), which lowers water tables and likely under-estimates ephemeral streams where pumping is significant. Ephemeral streams will only become more prevalent as groundwater pumping intensifies and water tables lower further [@goodrichSouthwesternIntermittentEphemeral2018; @scanlonGroundwaterDepletionSustainability2012; @jasechkoWidespreadPotentialLoss2021]. Overall, our analysis represents a conservative estimate of ephemeral hydrography and the ephemeral pulse of CONUS drainage networks.

![**Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`:** `r substr(fig_nums("figNflw", display="full"), 12, nchar(fig_nums("figNflw", display="full")))`](/nas/cee-water/cjgleason/craig/CONUS_ephemeral/cache/paper_figures/fig3.jpg)

The significance of the ephemeral contribution to drainage networks (Figs. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`-`r fig_nums("figQ_SO", display="n")`) is underpinned by how often they flow (Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`). Using 27 years of daily interpolated precipitation data [@xieGaugeBasedAnalysisDaily2007], we predict that ephemeral streams flow, on average across basins, `r meanFlowFreq` $\pm$ `r Nflw_se` days per year, but with most basins only flowing approximately 0-10 days in an average year (Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`a inset). Ephemeral flow frequency manifests as a balance of evapotranspiration, the size and frequency of precipitation events, and antecedent moisture conditions influencing runoff generation. For example, across western basins, ephemeral streams only flow `r  round(mean(combined_results[combined_results$huc4 %in% west, ]$num_flowing_dys),0)` days a year on average, while across eastern basins they flow `r  round(mean(combined_results[combined_results$huc4 %in% east, ]$num_flowing_dys),0)` days on average. In the arid southwestern United States, this drops to an average of `r round(mean(combined_results[substr(combined_results$huc4,1,2) %in% southwest, ]$num_flowing_dys),0)` days a year.

We note that our simple model uses only interpolated precipitation data, runoff data, and an operational definition for streamflow. It reasonably matches in situ sensor data of catchment-averaged ephemeral flow frequency (Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`b-c). With that said, we stress that extremely little data exists on ephemeral flow frequency at the drainage network scale (see Supplementary Materials). Future work should explore ephemeral runoff generation across distributed sensor networks to refine our modeling.

### Implications for downstream water quality
Given such infrequent flow, our results suggest that ephemeral streams likely dominate drainage network responses to storm events, shunting pollutants and other solutes downstream at even greater rates than suggested here under mean annual conditions [@raymondHydrologicalBiogeochemicalControls2016; @catalanPulseShuntStorage2022]. The exact impacts of ephemeral discharge on constituent and pollutant loads will be context dependent. However, the mobilization or delivery of most elements, nutrients and pollutants scales with discharge [@godseyCatchmentChemostasisRevisited2019; @godseyConcentrationDischargeRelationships2009] and is dominated by inputs from headwater streams [@alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007; @fritzPhysicalChemicalConnectivity2018], of which `r perc_firstOrder_eph`% of CONUS first order stream extent is ephemeral according to our model. Thus, we would expect the importance and impacts of ephemerally sourced water on stream and river chemistry to be relatively high in downstream regions that have accumulated large ephemeral water contributions (regardless of the specific loadings).

![**Fig. `r fig_nums("figLengthEph", display="n")`:** `r substr(fig_nums("figLengthEph", display="full"), 12, nchar(fig_nums("figLengthEph", display="full")))`](/nas/cee-water/cjgleason/craig/CONUS_ephemeral/cache/paper_figures/fig4.jpg)

Our findings show that ephemeral streams are likely a substantial pathway through which pollution may influence downstream water quality, a finding that can inform evaluation of the consequences of limiting United States federal jurisdiction over ephemeral streams under the CWA. In this context, we assess the geographic extent of the CWA with and without inclusion of ephemeral streams. We find that, on average across basins, ephemeral streams account for `r round(relativeLength[4]*100,0)`% of all drainage network extent (Fig. `r fig_nums("figLengthEph", display="n")`), noting that this estimate is underestimated due to a lower-bound on model resolution (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("scalingFig", display="n")`- see Supplementary Materials). Even as an underestimate, this still represents an upward revision of the only previous CONUS mapping effort that found 43-56% of the CONUS river network extent is ephemeral but with acknowledged errors of omission [@fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021].

Taking Figs. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`-`r fig_nums("figLengthEph", display="n")` in aggregate, along with regional assessments of headwater contributions to downstream water quality [@alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007; @fritzPhysicalChemicalConnectivity2018] and recent global assessments of non-perennial stream extent [@fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021; @messagerGlobalPrevalenceNonperennial2021], a consistent picture emerges. Non-perennial rivers (and in particular ephemeral streams) disproportionately influence river water composition and exert an outsized influence on global water, nutrient, and pollutant transport. This ephemeral influence directly implicates downstream water quality standards: excluding ephemeral streams from coverage under the CWA would significantly narrow the extent of federal authority to regulate water quality regulation in the United States.

### 1 Drainage network framework

#### 1.1 Overview

We use the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset High-Resolution (NHD-HR) built at 1:24,000 map scale [@u.s.geologicalsurveyNationalHydrographyDataset2022] for our drainage network hydrography. We use the data publicly available as of Spring 2022. This is the highest resolution hydrography data available and is often treated as a gold-standard to benchmark hydrography models against. The NHD-HR is discretized into 'reaches', which correspond to mass-conserved segments of rivers, streams, ditches, canals, lakes, and reservoirs. The NHD-HR uses artificial flowpaths to maintain network topology through lakes and reservoirs, and here we use a previously developed routing framework to handle complex lakes/reservoirs with multiple river inflows during our routing [@brinkerhoffLakeMorphometryRiver2021]. The NHD-HR also includes nested drainage basins across 12 scales. We run our model at the 4th level and our mapping validation at the 2nd level. This was done for purposes of data resolution, data availability across the United States, and ease of interpretation.

As will all human-built products, NHD-HR data quality varies across CONUS. We identified significantly higher drainage densities in the NHD-HR for the state of Indiana (often 1-2x the stream orders as other portions of a given basin in adjacent states). For these basins, we manually removed the lowest one or two stream orders within the Indiana portions of the basin, until the whole-basin drainage density was visually consistent across state lines. We also remove all divergent reaches, i.e. minor flowpaths that diverge from the main downstream path of flow. We do not remove the rest of the flowpath downstream of a divergent reach if there was another, non-divergent source that joined and made the path no longer divergent. Divergent channels are generally alternative flowpaths in multi-channel rivers, and so we remove them to avoid double-counting rivers.

#### 1.2 Discharge model

Each reach is associated with a mean annual discharge $\bar{Q}$ as modeled by the USGS [@u.s.geologicalsurveyNationalHydrographyDataset2022]. These are obtained through a runoff routing scheme that accounts for evapotranspirative losses. We validate the discharge model for 1970-2018 using all USGS streamgauges with at least 20 years of data within that time period. For additional validation in ephemeral streams, this dataset is supplemented with mean annual flow estimates from USGS streamgauges in ephemeral/intermittent streams, as defined by various workers in USGS reports [@delongEstimatingAverageDissolvedsolids1988; @ranklRelationsTotalsedimentLoad2004; @heijljr.PreliminaryAppraisalEphemeralstreamflow1980; @schumerCharacteristicsEphemeralHydrographs2014; @elliottHydraulicGeometryStreamflow1986]. For these sites, we do not require at least 20 years of data. To quality control the sites flagged as ephemeral for later use (section 4), we use satellite imagery and hydrograph analysis to manually verify that they are not more representative of an intermittent river, i.e. visual and graphical signs of persistent baseflow, persistently waterlogged soils, riparian zones with rooty vegetation. For all other streamgauges with at least 20 years of data, we identify ephemeral/intermittent streams as those which (on average) run dry at least 5 days a year, acknowledging that sometimes zero-flow readings at streamgauges reflect other scenarios than a dry channel [@zimmerZeroNotCauses2020]. Validation results are discussed in supplementary text S1 and plotted in Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`b. In total, we validate the discharge model at `r formatC(nDischargeValidation, format="d", big.mark=",")` rivers.

#### 1.3 Hydraulic Geometry

We use hydraulic geometry scaling to obtain estimates of mean annual river and lake/reservoir depth (necessary to assess ephemerality- Section 3.1). For rivers, we use the relation from @brinkerhoffRemotelySensingRiver2022, where the equation takes the form $H=c\bar{Q}^f$ on over 500,000 USGS in situ measurements of river channel depth *H* and discharge *Q* collated by @brinkerhoffReconcilingAtaStationAtManyStations2019. For lakes and reservoirs, we use mass-conservation to obtain average depths from lake/reservoir volume (*Vol*) and surface area *SA*. *Vol* was scaled using an equation of the form $Vol=a(SA)^{1.2}$ [@caelVolumeMeanDepth2017], developed using a global dataset of lake morphometry and the Hurst coefficient for self-affine surfaces.

#### 1.4 In situ data on stream ephemerality

We use a dataset of in situ assessments of 'stream ephemerality' to validate our stream classification model. This dataset comes from three sources: 1) EPA WOTUS jurisdictional determinations, 2) USGS streamgauges, and 3) field assessments of New England streams. Each dataset is described below.

The EPA 'Waters of the United States' (WOTUS) jurisdictional determinations dataset [@u.s.environmentalprotectionagencyCWAApprovedJDs] consists of field assessments performed by EPA workers made at landowners' requests, where status was determined under the at-the-time definition for WOTUS extent. We use the data available as of 06/20/2022 when downloaded. We filter this dataset to include only determinations made under the Navigable Waters Protection Rule [NWPR- @u.s.armycorpsofengineersdepartmentofthearmydepartmentofdefenseNavigableWatersProtection2020] after it was enacted in 2020, which includes an explicit category for ephemeral streams. This amounts to over 60,000 distinct jurisdictional determinations (often including multiple determinations in the same reach, over space and time) and forms the bulk of our dataset. To make the dataset copacetic with our model, we remove data not associated with surface water features directly connected to the drainage network: adjacent/riparian wetlands, drylands, upland terrestrial sites, upland or non-adjacent wetlands/ponds/depressions, croplands, wastewater plants, and groundwater. We retained all other determinations that are directly connected to the drainage network (rivers, lakes, reservoirs, canals, ditches, stormwater control features, and artificial surface water features) and recast all determinations as ephemeral or non-ephemeral.

We supplement the jurisdictional determinations dataset with the USGS streamgauge network. Because the EPA jurisdictional determinations are done on a voluntary basis at landowners' requests, it is biased towards waterbodies whose WOTUS status is not so easily discerned. Thus, the EPA jurisdictional determinations rarely include larger (usually perennial) rivers. To make sure we are also correctly classifying larger rivers, we include gauged rivers (section 1.2) in our validation. All gauged rivers that, on average, are flowing 95% of the year are conservatively assumed to be non-ephemeral, and are added to the dataset as such.

Finally, we manually assess stream ephemerality in northeastern CONUS because our validation data includes no ephemeral reaches in this region. We follow the 'expert protocol' used by North Carolina's department of Water Quality for assessing stream ephemerality [@dorneyChapterNorthCarolina2018]. This protocol uses geomorphic, hydrologic, and biotic indicators of seasonally and/or permanently high water tables to assess stream permanence. We use our local knowledge to identify streams we thought are likely to be ephemeral, verify they are present in the NHD-HR (but did not look at the model result a priori to avoid biasing our assessments) and assess the channels following the protocol. Classification results are in Table S`r table_nums("field_data",display="n")` for the five sites. All streams are assessed over 48 hours from the most recent rain event to avoid the influence of delayed runoff in the channel that might be mistaken for baseflow. Note that we do not perform full soil assessments nor species counts as the protocol technically specifies, but instead perform rapid visual assessments that favor speed of classification over thoroughness. Per the protocol, none of these channels are close enough to being classified as intermittent (Table S`r table_nums("field_data",display="n")`) that we feel confident our rapid assessments are sufficient. While we only assess five ephemeral rivers, they provide at least some validation data in northeastern CONUS.

We join the three datasets to the NHD-HR by snapping each field assessment to the nearest reach. Despite its high resolution, the NHD-HR does not contain every stream in CONUS and many of the field sites are not expected to be associated with a reach. We settle on a threshold of 10m. The tests and rationale used to drive this decision are explained in section 3.3. After snapping, we assign the most frequently occurring field assessment along the reach as its 'true assessment of ephemerality'. If there is a tie between frequency of occurrence (meaning there is no consensus on whether the reach is ephemeral or non-ephemeral), we remove those points from the dataset. Ultimately, we have `r formatC(nrow(validationResults$validation_fin), format='d', big.mark=',')` field assessments of reach ephemerality to validate our model. Fig S2b maps the regional distribution of these data.

### 2 Calculating ephemeral contributions
We calculate the ephemeral percent of discharge (equation S1) and drainage area (equation S2) for all `r formatC(nreaches, format="d", big.mark=",")` reaches by routing through the drainage network from upstream to downstream. When a basin discharges into a downstream drainage network, we pass the exporting reach's value to the downstream basin's corresponding reach. Routing between basins was facilitated by a custom routine which runs the drainage network routing in parallel across basins at the same 'processing level' and then passes exported parameters of interest to the basins immediately downstream in the next processing level. To calculate the basin-exported values for equations S1 and S2, we sum up the ephemeral percentages at all terminal reaches in the basin (sometimes rivers terminate endorheically and occasionally basins have two or more outlets) and then re-calculate equations S1 and S2. We also calculate the mean annual ephemeral flow frequency (equation S3, section 4).

More specifically, the ephemeral contribution to discharge $E_Q$ (equation S1) is the average of each discharge source's ephemeral contribution, weighted by discharge to favor larger water sources. *k* refers to each reach directly upstream and $Q_l$ is the lateral runoff contribution from the current reach's catchment. $E_{Q_l}$ is set to 1 for ephemeral streams and 0 for non-ephemeral streams. For losing streams (when discharge decreases downstream due to evapotranspirative losses or groundwater seepage), $E_Q_l$ is set to 0 as there is no lateral contribution into the stream channel. Equation S1 is mapped in Fig. `r fig_nums("figQ", display="n")`a.

$$E_Q = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^K{(E_{Q_k}{Q_k}})+E_{Q_l}Q_l}{\sum_{k=1}^K{(Q_k)}+Q_l}  \mathbf{(S1)}$$

The ephemeral percent of drainage area $E_A$ (equation S2) is the average of each discharge source's ephemeral drainage area, weighted by drainage area to favor larger water sources. *A* is the upstream drainage area. Equation S2 is mapped in Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("drainageAreaMap", display="n")`.
$$E_A = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^K{(E_{A_k}{A_k}})+E_{A_l}A_l}{\sum_{k=1}^K{(A_k)}+A_l} \mathbf{(S2)}$$

Finally, we calculate basin-average ephemeral flow frequency $N_{flw}$ (equation S3) as the percent of an average year (in days) that ephemeral streams are flowing, where *i* is mean daily runoff depth and $i_{min}$ is an operational runoff threshold for day *d* in the multi-year record *D*. This calculation is elaborated on in section 4. Equation S3 is mapped in Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`a.

$$N_{flw} = \frac{\sum_{d=1}^{D}(i \geq i_{min})}{D}*365 \mathbf{(S3)}$$

### 3 Identifying ephemeral streams
#### 3.1 Model
We use a ~1km global soil hydrology model for mean monthly estimates of the water table depth (*WTD*)[@fanHydrologicRegulationPlant2017; @fanGlobalPatternsGroundwater2013]. This model solves a vertical soil water balance as inferred from remotely sensed leaf area index [@fanHydrologicRegulationPlant2017]. It ignores local, perched aquifers and anthropogenic pumping in favor of a broad, long-term average *WTD*, as is common in global-scale groundwater models [@condonGlobalGroundwaterModeling2021; @degraafHighresolutionGlobalscaleGroundwater2015]. Ignoring pumping likely leads to an underestimation of ephemeral streams, as the modeled water table is artificially high relative to the observed water table that has been lowered by pumping. Under these cases, we likely mis-classify ephemeral streams as perennial and thus underestimate the total ephemeral influence in an intensively pumped region.

We extract the median *WTD* along all `r formatC(sum(combined_results$n_total), format="d", big.mark=",")` discrete reaches for all 12 months. We perform an initial classification of ephemeral/non-ephemeral based solely on water table depth below the reach: if *WTD* is deeper than river/lake/reservoir depth plus a 1cm buffer, for all twelve months of the year, it is classed as ephemeral. To avoid mis-classifying streams with an intermittently high/low water table, this must hold true for all twelve months of the year. We treat all 'main ponded waters', i.e. lakes/reservoirs $\geq 0.01 km^2$ [@schmadelSmallPondsHeadwater2019], as non-ephemeral to ensure that perennial waterbodies are not mis-classified.

Then, we route through the network from upstream to downstream and amend our initial classification to a more conservative estimate. Specifically, if a drainage path has a perennial/intermittent river or main ponded water upstream of it, the current reach must also be non-ephemeral. Even if the upstream river only provides an intermittent groundwater contribution, at an annual timescale the next river downstream must also receive some amount of groundwater and thus is also non-ephemeral (endorheic outlets are already accounted for in our model). We also handle two other scenarios:

- We only count rivers/streams as ephemeral and recast all canals, ditches, and small ponds (waterbodies $< 0.01 km^2$) as non-ephemeral. These features fall under different WOTUS rules and are not the focus of this study.

- While Mexican and Canadian ephemeral streams contribute discharge to the CONUS drainage network, our focus is on CONUS rivers. These streams are thus recast as non-ephemeral.

#### 3.2 Validation

Ephemeral classification accuracy is assessed using the in situ ephemerality dataset (Section 1.4). We assess performance using regional classification accuracy, sensitivity (the true positive rate), specificity (the true negative rate), and "informedness", which is also called the true skill statistic (*TSS*) or Youden's *J* depending on the literature [@alloucheAssessingAccuracySpecies2006]. See Table S`r table_nums("classVal", display="n")` for metric definitions. *TSS* is equal to the sensitivity + specificity - 1. It intuitively represents the performance improvement over a random classifier, i.e. a score of zero indicates that the model is equivalent to random guessing. Mathematically, *TSS* equals the distance (in units of sensitivity) between a point on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and a random classifier. *TSS* is more robust to class imbalances than simple percent accuracy and it has been used in the past to assess headwater and ephemeral mapping models [@fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021; @russellSpatiallyExplicitModel2015; @cavalloExploitingSentinel2Dataset2022]. We therefore use it here as well to compare against existing studies. Regional accuracy is mapped in Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`, regional *TSS* is mapped in Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("val2", display="n")`, regional sensitivity and specificity are mapped in Fig. S3, and boxplots of all metrics are Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("val4", display="n")`. The validation results are discussed in supplementary text S1.

#### 3.3 Choosing a validation snapping threshold
In general, classification performance should decrease as the snapping threshold increases because the in situ data will be assigned to the wrong rivers. So, we test the sensitivity of our model to this threshold to inform our choice of parameter value.

First, we re-project all data using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection system to ensure snapping distances are regionally accurate. Then, we test a range of snapping thresholds from 5m to 50m and assess ephemeral classification accuracy (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("classificationSens", display="n")`). We also test which snapping thresholds reproduce expected network scaling patterns according to Horton's law of stream numbers [@hortonErosionalDevelopmentStreams1945]. Equation S4 is the Horton law of stream numbers, which is a power-law function relating stream order $SO_m$ to the number of streams in the $m^{th}$ order $N_m$ [@hortonErosionalDevelopmentStreams1945]. $R_B$ is the Horton ratio and $N_{max}$ is the number of streams in the largest order. $R_B$ is solved via least-squares regression.

$$N_m=N_{max}*R_B^{SO_{max} - SO_m} \mathbf{(S4)}$$

We fit equation S4 to our in situ ephemerality data after snapping to the NHD-HR using some threshold. We then assess how well the observed $N_{m}$ (section 1.4) matches the $N_{m}$ predicted by Horton's laws (equation S4). This approach assumes the following:

- Ephemeral streams aggregated from many CONUS drainage networks will fit a single Horton scaling. Horton laws are a statistical inevitability of stream ordering and do not represent an inherent geomorphic process [@kirchnerStatisticalInevitabilityHorton1993; @miltonGeomorphicIrrelevanceDrainage1966; @bowdenEffectStreamorderingTechnique1964], but rather arise from hydrography resolution and channelization definitions. Because we use a CONUS-scale product with consistent stream ordering, this is reasonable.

- The in situ ephemerality data (section 1.4) is representative of the actual distribution of ephemeral streams across CONUS. Because these data consist of voluntary field assessments, it is likely an underestimate of ephemeral stream presence. Actual estimates are presumably even greater.

Overall, we find that the ephemeral river network most closely matches expected network scaling with a snapping threshold of 5-15m (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("snappingSens", display="n")`). Otherwise, this scaling relationship begins to break down. Taking Figs. S`r fig_nums_supp("classificationSens", display="n")`-S`r fig_nums_supp("snappingSens", display="n")` in aggregate, we find a snapping threshold of 10m to be most appropriate for our purposes. This threshold also conveniently allows a direct comparison against the only existing ephemeral classification model [@fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021], built using 10m gridded flow accumulation data.

#### 3.4 Influence of hydrography resolution
Given that much of the in situ ephemerality data does not fall on the mapped drainage network and instead corresponds to streams too small to be explicitly represented in the NHD-HR, we also assess 1) the amount of ephemeral streams we are missing, and 2) whether this matters for our goals of quantifying ephemeral contributions to CONUS discharge. To do this, equation S4 can be re-expressed as equation S5 to calculate the ephemeral stream orders not represented in the NHD-HR, where *k* is the minimum stream order. The in situ ephemerality data (section 1.4) provides us with $N_k$ enabling the direct calculation of $SO_k$. This approach assumes that all streams in the scaled stream order(s) are ephemeral. Given that `r perc_riverSource_eph`% of CONUS 'source reach' extent is ephemeral in our model, it is reasonable to assume that everything upstream of these is also ephemeral.

$$SO_k = \frac{log(N_k) - log(N_{max}) - SO_{max}log(R_B)}{-log(R_B)} \mathbf{(S5)}$$

Using equation S5, we find that one additional ephemeral stream order would need to be added to the NHD-HR to reproduce the field data distribution (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("scalingFig", display="n")`). The likely significant omission errors in the in situ ephemerality data suggest that one additional stream order is a conservative estimate. Because of these results (and because discharge and drainage area generally accumulate downstream), we can safely assume that our model's headwater ephemeral discharge contributions implicitly include the scaled ephemeral stream order as well, despite not being explicitly mapped in the NHD-HR.

### 4 Estimating ephemeral flow frequency
We estimate the basin-average flow frequency of ephemeral streams via the mean annual number of days per year that they flow ($N_{flw}$- equation S3). We do this using mean annual, basin-averaged runoff data measured at streamgauges [@brakebillDigitalHydrologicNetworks2011] and 27 years of daily interpolated precipitation data for 1980-2006 [@xieGaugeBasedAnalysisDaily2007]. The model is purposefully simple but globally scalable (Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`).

#### 4.1 Data
We use field data only to determine an operational runoff threshold, as well to verify the model's performance. Note that in situ $N_{flw}$ data is relatively uncommon and measured using different sensors (streamgauges, temporary flumes, and electrical resistance senors). To our knowledge, we use all existing field data [@zimmerBidirectionalStreamGroundwater2017; @fritzCoarseParticulateOrganic2019; @kampfRainfallThresholdsFlow2018; @slaughterThirtyfiveYearsResearch2001; @stoneLongtermRunoffDatabase2008; @schoenerImpactUrbanizationStormwater2022; @strombergRiparianVegetationEphemeral2017; @peirceCharacterizingEphemeralStreams2015] that provides sufficient information to calculate $N_{flw}$ (Table S`r table_nums("Nflw_data", display="n")` details the studies). We also supplement this data with the ephemeral USGS streamgauges previously described in section 1.2. To get all data in a uniform format, we calculate mean annual $N_{flw}$ at each sensor (if applicable), and then take the catchment average $N_{flw}$ across the sensed streams (again, if applicable). This averaging was not done in catchments with insufficient data and therefore significant uncertainties exist in many of these estimates. Despite these uncertainties, this limited data is to our knowledge the largest collection of in situ $N_{flw}$ measurements.

Length of the timeseries varies significantly, from approximately 1/3 of a year [@peirceCharacterizingEphemeralStreams2015] to 45 years of sub-daily data in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed [@stoneLongtermRunoffDatabase2008]. Data from @peirceCharacterizingEphemeralStreams2015 exist for three sites within a catchment in Ontario that do not flow into the United States. However, they are located approximately 15 km from one of our model basins that does flow into the United States (Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`a) and so we use that basin for verification. Additionally, that data is only for 1/3 of the year (approximately July to October). To obtain a mean annual estimate, we assumed the frequency of flow was the same year round, i.e. we tripled the $N_{flw}$ measured in their study. Likewise, @fritzCoarseParticulateOrganic2019 only assessed their streams for the latter half of a year, though reports indicate that flow generally occurs only 1-2 times in the remaining months [@fritzStructuralFunctionalCharacteristics2010], so we added that to the calculation. Finally, one site [@zimmerBidirectionalStreamGroundwater2017] includes an intermittent main stem where the flow was measured, however the rest of the drainage system is ephemeral [@zimmerBidirectionalStreamGroundwater2017].

#### 4.2 Model
Streams are traditionally viewed as a surficial expression of groundwater [@winterGroundWaterSurface1999]. However, by definition ephemeral streams extend beyond the boundary of the surface extent of groundwater [@zimmerLateralVerticalLongitudinal2018]. Because they have no groundwater component, $N_{flw}$ is purely controlled by surface runoff and interflow. This assumption significantly simplifies our modeling and enables the calculation of $N_{flw}$ solely via surface runoff generation.

In that context, we first calculate a mean annual basin runoff ratio $i_r$ to convert precipitation *P* to stream runoff *i* and vice versa. The runoff ratio (equation S6) reflects the proportion of rainfall on the basin that winds up as stream runoff, where the implicit losses are via groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration. Using a mean annual $i_r$ also implicitly accounts for snowmelt runoff in winter.

$$i_r = \frac{i}{P} \mathbf{(S6)}$$

We convert daily precipitation depth to daily, basin-averaged stream runoff depth using $i_r$. Per equation S3, streamflow occurs when daily runoff exceeds some operational runoff threshold. We tally all days when flow occurs over the 27 years and calculate a mean annual $N_{flw}$, which is mapped in Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`a. For a handful of basins on the Mexican/Canadian borders, there are no USGS gauges and no $i_r$ data. We use the mean annual runoff values from adjacent basins (the "closest" as assessed visually) and assume it holds constant in these basins. We perform a sensitivity test of the $i_r$ data, as it is biased towards gauged, often larger, rivers. For this test, we use equation S3 and run the model under four scenarios: inflating and deflating the runoff ratio by 18% and 33%. Across CONUS, results change minimally (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("nFlwSens", display="n")`).

We also parameterize watershed 'memory': a bulk parameter representing all delayed runoff to the drainage network. More practically, the memory parameter keeps streams 'turned on' for a number of days following a day identified as flowing. Memory parameter assignment was guided by a recent analysis [@mogesStrengthMemoryPrecipitation2022], which calculated the streamflow memory of rain events for 671 watersheds in CONUS (including many with groundwater influence). They found a median memory of approximately 4 days, which is used here.

The operational $i_{min}$ is determined using the $N_{flw}$ field data (section 4.1) as, to our knowledge, there is no consensus on what runoff depth defines a flowing stream. Further, the coarse spatial resolution of our precipitation data can't reconcile sub-pixel heterogeneity and thus limits our ability to remotely sense the smallest runoff events (potentially inflating the smallest rain events at the sub-pixel scale). So, we calibrate $i_{min}$ in lieu of other available data, acknowledging that this operational definition of $i_{min}$ may change with additional field measurements of $N_{flw}$. We use the coefficient of determination $r^2$, the mean absolute error (*MAE*) and the root mean square error (*RMSE*) to determine the best performing $i_{min}$ of approximately 2.5 mm/day (Fig. `r fig_nums("figNflw", display="n")`b-c, Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("runoffCalib", display="n")`). We express uncertainty in the average estimate as 1 standard error (SE) of the regression between predicted and observed. We stress that because of the limited and highly uncertain data on $N_{flw}$ and the necessary calibration of $i_{min}$, we refer to this as a model verification: all we can do is confirm that the model is reasonably realistic.

## Supplementary Text S1: Model performance
### Discharge model performance
The discharge model accurately captures mean annual discharges for 1970-2018 across both perennial and non-perennial streams (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`). This performance is similar to another discharge model used to map global river intermittency [@messagerGlobalPrevalenceNonperennial2021].

### Classification performance
Ephemeral mapping performance varies across the United States. Regional average *TSS* is `r round(mean(val_shapefile_fin$basinTSS, na.rm=T),2)` (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("val2", display="n")`a), average regional accuracy is `r ceiling(mean(val_shapefile_fin$basinAccuracy)*100)`% (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`a), average regional sensitivity is `r ceiling(mean(val_shapefile_fin$basinSensitivity, na.rm=T)*100)`% (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("val3", display="n")`a) and average regional specificity was `r round(mean(val_shapefile_fin$basinSpecificity*100),0)`% (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("val3", display="n")`b). Performance is best in northeastern CONUS and western CONUS (average *TSS* of `r round(mean(val_shapefile_fin[val_shapefile_fin$huc2 %in% goodAccuracy,]$basinTSS),2)`), while performance is worse in the Ohio and Lower Mississippi river basins (average *TSS* of `r round(mean(val_shapefile_fin[val_shapefile_fin$huc2 %in% badAccuracy,]$basinTSS),2)`). Overall, we outperform the only existing continental-scale ephemeral stream map [@fesenmyerLargePortionUSA2021], which reported a CONUS *TSS* of 0.45, sensitivity of 63%, and specificity of 83%.

### Performance in an ephemeral catchment
The Walnut Gulch experimental watershed in Arizona is home to one of the longest continuous ephemeral streamgauge records in the world and features an in situ flume network that enables whole-watershed studies for arid hydrology [@stoneLongtermRunoffDatabase2008]. The entire watershed drainage network is ephemeral. Here, we verify that our model 1) reproduces the completely-ephemeral drainage system (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("walnutGulch", display="n")`a) and 2) reproduces the mean annual ephemeral discharges throughout the drainage network (Fig. S`r fig_nums_supp("walnutGulch", display="n")`b).

### Equations S1 and S2 performance
At continental scales, it is impossible to validate equations S1 and S2 in a traditional sense. To broadly verify that our calculations make sense, we extend previous work by @alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007, who used Tokunaga network scaling in the northeastern US to quantify relative headwater contributions to downstream discharge. Tokunaga ratios represent the average number of upstream reaches that flow into the average reach per stream order [@zanardoAreAmericanRivers2013; @alexanderRoleHeadwaterStreams2007]. Assuming that discharge accumulates downstream, relative ephemeral Tokunaga ratios should be approximately similar to our routing calculations, i.e. if 50% of upstream rivers are ephemeral, than 50% of discharge would be ephemerally sourced in a perfectly gaining watershed.

Here, we use Tokunaga ratios to calculate the average number of upstream ephemeral rivers per stream order, using network length rather than number of reaches due to the artificial paths necessary to incorporate lakes and reservoirs into the drainage network [@brinkerhoffLakeMorphometryRiver2021]. When compared against our equation S1 results (Fig S`r fig_nums_supp("mainVal", display="n")`c), this analysis confirms that our model is in line with those anticipated by network scaling theory.
