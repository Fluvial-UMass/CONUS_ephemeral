Ephemeral pollution potential $Eph_{plp}$ is expressed as the drainage network extent that is ephemeral and flowing through cultivated/developed riparian lands. While there is no guarantee that there will be pollution discharged into one of any one of these ephemeral streams, in general cultivated and/or developed lands are associated with the potential for point-source pollution via farms, manufacturing facilities, concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs), sand and gravel operations, and other similar activities. We calculate this using equation S3, where *L* is the length of ephemeral/cultivated/developed reach *ecd* (a subset of all reaches *k*). This calculation is elaborated on in section 6. Equation S3 is mapped in Fig. 3.

$$Eph_{plp}= \frac{\sum_{ecd = 1}^{ECD} L_{ecd}}{\sum_{k = 1}^{K} L} \mathbf{(S3)}$$

Finally, we create a composite index to identify basins where the three axes (equations S1-S3) combine to create potentially significant water quality degradation if the NWPR is enacted. The 'NWPR impact index' $Eph_{WQD}$ (equation S4) is simply the average of equations S1-S3 after re-scaling such that all have equivalent weights from 0-1. Re-scaling is done using equation S5 for metric *x*, basin *k*, and normalized metric *z*. nRe-scaling allows for a relative comparison across basins and metrics to identify potential hotspots for NWPR impacts (or lack thereof).

$$NWPR_{impact} = \frac{z(Eph_{vol}) + z(Eph_{freq}) + z(Eph_{plp})}{3} \mathbf{(S4)}$$


$$z(x)= \frac{x_k - min(x)}{max(x)-min(x)}\mathbf{(S5)}$$
