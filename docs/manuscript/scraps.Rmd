Fig. 1b-d and Fig. 2 both suggest that landscape geomorphology and hydrology drive the regional patterns in ephemeral drainage network export (Fig. 1a). In the arid Great Plains, Great Basin, and Southwest, prevailing topographic and climatic conditions create an environment characterized by quick-draining soils with a penchant for Hortonian runoff [@buchananEstimatingDominantRunoff2018], sparse but deep-rooting vegetation disconnected from groundwater [@fanHydrologicRegulationPlant2017], and recharge-controlled water tables independent of regional topography [@fanGlobalPatternsGroundwater2013; @condonEvaluatingRelationshipTopography2015; @gleesonClassifyingWaterTable2011]. In aggregate, these properties lead to a proliferation of ephemeral streams and infrequent but large runoff events. East coast drainage networks are also significantly ephemeral (Fig. 1a), but this is strongly associated with topographically-driven groundwater flow [@condonEvaluatingRelationshipTopography2015; @gleesonClassifyingWaterTable2011]. This means that the major rivers in the basins are nearly always perennial and constitute most of the discharge signal. In the basins around the Mississippi-Ohio and Columbia River systems, the ephemeral export fraction is near zero as it is impossible to compete with two of the world's largest rivers by volume.
